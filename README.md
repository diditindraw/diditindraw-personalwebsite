Didit Indra Official Personal Portfolio or Resume Website
Personal Portfolio Website for the purpose of displaying a series of works along with their processes, values, skills, and experiences gained for career or professional purposes. I created this website using Vibe Coding techniques with the AI Gemini Canvas feature, then modified or re-edited its appearance, including button colors, added information, and features such as CV Download, Location, and Contact in Visual Studio Code.
